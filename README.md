# 🌍 Spots App – Personal Version

Welcome to my personal version of the *Spots App, originally a group task assigned to *Circle 13 students at *AltSchool Africa, School of Engineering*.

While this project began as a team collaboration, I created this standalone version to *further develop my frontend and JavaScript skills*. It includes all core layouts from the original assignment, with added dynamic functionality that I built personally.

## 📌 Project Overview

Spots App is a responsive user interface inspired by a Figma design. Initially built with HTML and CSS, this personal version extends the project with *JavaScript-powered interactivity*.

> 🎯 Features like profile editing, post creation, and post interaction (likes) have now been implemented using JavaScript.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Figma (for UI reference)

## ✨ Features Implemented

## 🤝 About the Group Assignment

This project was originally created as part of a *Circle 13* team assignment at AltSchool Africa.  
Alongside contributing to the group project, I built this version personally to practice advanced JavaScript concepts and also for my personal growth.
